/**
 * Survival Arena bootstrap (host glue). The GAME is data — game.json + config.json +
 * the three JSON scenes (title → play → over) wired by `flow.on` edges, composing
 * @gitcade/library + SDK parts ONLY. There are NO custom behaviors: the level-driven
 * enemy toughness/speed ramp (once `swarm-scale`, LIBRARY-GAPS #8) is now pure DATA via
 * two library `scale-by-state` instances in play.json. See custom-behaviors/index.ts.
 *
 * 0.2.0 made the screen flow expressible as DATA (scene `flow`, `tap-emit`,
 * declarative `persist`), so the old ~306-line GameShell screen-state machine and
 * its HTML menu overlays are GONE. This file keeps ONLY host concerns that have no
 * data primitive: the library audio, the FX SHOWCASE *screen-level* juice (the
 * per-kill burst is DATA — a local `explosion` at each dead enemy; the host owns only
 * the screen-shake/flash the frozen renderer can't do from a behavior: a small shake
 * when the PLAYER is hit, a bigger shake + red flash on death, a blue flash on
 * level-up), an Enter bridge mirroring the on-screen flow buttons for keyboard
 * players, and a pause toggle (freezing the sim is a host-loop concern). No balance
 * or game logic lives here.
 *
 * 0.4.0 (E2): the per-frame HUD mirror is GONE — the library `format-binding` system
 * in each scene now derives the HUD as DATA (player hp → the bar's `hp`/`maxHp`, the
 * float timer → an integer `clock`, `best` → `bestDisplay`, and the win/lose `outcome`
 * → the game-over headline).

// --- FX showcase: screen juice (presentation only) ---------------------------
// This game is the FX demo. The per-KILL juice is DATA — a local `explosion` burst
// at each dead enemy (play.json), which reads far better at swarm density than a
// global shake: a shake on every kill never settles between kills, so under a dense
// swarm it degrades into a constant rumble that flattens the bigger beats AND hurts
// readability (you can't parse threats through a perpetually-jittering field). So the
// host reserves SCREEN-shake for player-stakes moments the renderer can't express
// from a behavior:
//  - the player taking a hit  → a small shake, rate-limited so a pile-on can't
//    strobe. Deliberately NO full-screen flash: getting hit is a frequent/routine
//    event, and a full-screen flash on a routine action is the exact anti-pattern
//    this audit pass exists to kill — the shake conveys the hit without washing the
//    field. (The "damage" event fires for EVERY contact-damage hit, including the
//    player's bullets hitting enemies, so we gate on the player being the target.)
//  - the player dying         → a big shake + red flash (a rare, decisive beat).
//  - a level-up               → a blue flash (rare, and paired with a sparkle burst).
